# Professional Development: Networking Plan

## Group Name

* Bootcampers Collective

## Meet-up Date/Time

* JavaScript study group every Monday 1-3pm

Spend 5 minutes looking at upcoming networking events on meetup.com, builtin.com, or other social networking sites to make a plan for 1 that you can attend between now and the end of Module 3 (this is part of your deliverable). To ensure that it's doable for you, make a plan! Decide:

## Why is this particular event interesting to you? How can you connect with others at this event?

* This group interests me for several reasons.

1.  I am interested to see how other bootcamp students and graduates approach the job search in anticipation of and after graduation.
2.  The group provides software development services to small businesses and non-profit organizations and provides opportunities for members to contribute and get paid for their contributions.
3.  The group is also involved in several open-source code projects and encourage their members to contribute.

## Who will go with you? Will you attend by yourself?

* I will initially attend alone.  But if I find it to be a valuable organization, then I will as classmates to attend future meet-ups.

## What logistics do you need to figure out in order to attend?

* The study group is held in Boulder on a school day.  The meet-up is held weekly, so I would have to find a day when no instruction is being held in the afternoon.
