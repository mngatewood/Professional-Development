# Feedback 2 Reflection

## Date of feedback conversation: 
<br>12/22/2017

## How did you prepare for the conversation? 
* Reflecting over the project, I thought about our challenges and the methods we both employed to overcome obstacles.  I thought about the compromises I made for my partner to better the process and being aware of many of my own weaknesses, I also considered the compromises he may have made.  I noted some positive feedback for my partner and was prepared to discuss some ideas of how we could have improved.

## How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

* My partner and I got along very well, so this conversation was not particularly uncomfortable.  We had polar-opposite working styles, but we had more than one prior conversation about this.  We were both aware of our differences and we both compromised to the extent needed in order to be successful.  The biggest key to our success was constant communication.  The only difficult part for me was providing constructive coaching feedback.  I take criticism very naturally, but it has always been more difficult to dish it out. 

## What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
* Appreciation, Coaching, Empathy, Non-Violent Communication

## Any other comments:
