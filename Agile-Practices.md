# Agile Practices & Leadership Reflection

## How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:

### What were you already doing?

* I have always tried to use agile project management practices whenever possible.  Rather than "sticking to the plan," I prefer to adjust the plan according to my progress and experience.  This means meeting with my supervisor, peers, and subordinates on a regular basis to ensure that our plan is always the best approach at any given time.  For the scope of the projects and teams I have worked on/with, this is usually a weekly meeting.  For smaller projects, this could be a daily meeting.  If there is a better way of doing things, we adjust the plan accordingly.

### What did you put into place in Module Two?

* In all of my pairings, I have always suggested using the approach stated above (though these "meetings" were really just quick conversations).  I have also tried to improve my mastery of the tools we use in our development process, such as gitHub and Waffle.

### What was effective?

* Frequent and honest communication has been the key to success in my previous pairings.

### What do you want to improve on in future projects?

* Whenever I DTR, I always make a promise to spend no more than 30 minutes struggling with a particular challenge.  However, I frequently find myself breaking those promisses because I often feel that I'm on the verge of a breakthrough.  In the future, I plan to be more disciplined and ask for help with these challenges sooner and more frequently.

### Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?

* My role changes from project to project.  Most of the time, I am the technical expert of my pairing.  Occasionally, I am not.  But I always go to great extents to make my teammates comfortable and want to pair with me again (sometimes to my own detriment).  When a particularly challenging obstacle is presented, I bring to the table the ability to keep the team calm and take a logical and strategic approach to troubleshooting and problem solving.  When others are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, I am the one to restore order and break down the problem to manageable pieces.
